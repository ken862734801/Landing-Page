# Practice-Landing-Page

Revisiting a Naval Ravikant inspired landing page I made for the odin project.
The aim of the project was to use HTML, CSS, and some Javascript to create a mock landing page.
I went back and used flex to make the website more responsive. 

Will be adding media queries to make it mobile responsive in the future.
