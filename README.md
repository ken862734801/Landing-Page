## Summary
Revisiting a Naval Ravikant inspired landing page I made for the Odin Project.
The aim of the assignment was to use HTML and CSS to create a mock landing page based off of a template provided by the Odin Project curriculum.

CSS grid, Flex, and Media queries were the main concepts used for this assignment. Javascript was also used to create a random quote generator. 

## Resources
Canva was used to create the podcast episode covers.

These UI templates served as inspiration for the design.
